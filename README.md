# Simple Discord player info bot

Simple Discord bot that would look up into game database and post info about players in Discord chat when called by command in public chat.
The defined role (Admin) could send message to the bot in private chat to send a RCON command to a server.

This was first try of creating a Discord bot so it is probably not best example but it served its purpose reliably.

Can be deployed on Heroku and works for free there, tested. :)
